/*
 * Bird class -- STARTER SCAFFOLD
 *
 * Your job is to fill this in. Every TODO below corresponds to a line item on
 * the assignment rubric. Work top to bottom: properties, constants,
 * constructor, then methods. Load birds.php in a browser after each step so
 * you find your mistakes one at a time instead of all at once.
 *
 * Your model is private/classes/bicycle.class.php from the chapter 7 videos.
 * Nearly everything here has a direct counterpart there. Where it does not,
 * the comment says so.
 *
 * REMINDER: above each item marked "why comment required" you must write a
 * block comment explaining how the code is used and WHY it exists -- what
 * problem it solves and what would break if you did it a simpler way. A
 * comment that only restates the code earns no credit.
